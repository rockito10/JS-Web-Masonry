This is a masonry done on typescript. 
To make it work, simply open the index.html on your browser.
The images will kind of align, tho keep in mind if you move them, it will overlap and leave 
holes.

The main idea is that you can put multiple images and they should avoid leaving holes between 
them, basically it uses a detection done on three parts of the width of the image or video, if 
it fits then it is placed. On the X axis, it just adds whatever width the previous img or vid had (so the next one is put right next to it).

Controls:
-right click to grab
-right click to release
-middle click to resize down
-left click to resize up
-while holding img or vid, d to delete
-enter to press button
-backspace to press video button
