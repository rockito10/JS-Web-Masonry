# JS-Web-Masonry
A simple masonry page to display multiple images. Works together with my other project image-popper-extension.

# To use
Add your image urls to the bar in the middle, then press add or Enter key.
This will display your images in a masonry-like style.
You can move them around with right click, zoom in with left click and zoom out with middle click.
